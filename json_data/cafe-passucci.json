	"description": "The main key factors which differentiate a Caffe Pascucci Coffee Shop from other coffee outlets in Mysore are – the usage of Pascucci’s exclusive blend, consisting of a range of coffee beans sourced from many countries across the globe and roasted in a unique process in Pascucci’s ultra modern roasting plant, in Montecerignone. All coffee used in the blends are selected through a rigorous process, from the plantation stage itself. The recipes are a result of continuous research by a team of dedicated coffee experts. Pascucci’s chocolate drinks are unique in taste and consistency. All baristas are trained by the Pascucci Espresso School.",
